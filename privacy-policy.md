## Overview
Kaggie is a Chrome extension that provides AI-powered assistance for Kaggle machine learning competitions. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data Collection
**We do not collect any personal data.** Kaggie operates with a privacy-first approach:

- **No personal information collected**: We don't collect names, emails, addresses, or any identifying information
- **No tracking or analytics**: We don't track user behavior, clicks, or usage patterns

## Local Data Storage
Kaggie stores the following data locally in your browser only:

- **API Keys**: OpenAI and Tavily API keys you provide (stored securely in Chrome's local storage)
- **Conversation History**: Your chat conversations with the AI assistant
- **Settings**: Your extension preferences and configurations

This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to our servers.

## Third-Party Services
When you use Kaggie, it may connect to:

- **OpenAI API**: Using your own API key for AI responses
- **Tavily API**: Using your own API key for web search
- **Kaggie Backend**: For competition data retrieval (no personal data sent)

These connections use your own API keys and are made directly from your browser.

- You control all your data and can delete it anytime through the extension settings
