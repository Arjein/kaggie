## 🔍 Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. Security Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL - FIXED)
**Issue**: Live API keys and credentials exposed in repository
```env
# Before (EXPOSED):
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key_here

# After (SECURE):
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**Actions Taken**:
- ✅ Created `.env.example` template
- ✅ Replaced exposed keys with placeholders
- ✅ Added comprehensive security documentation
- ✅ Created `SECURITY.md` with setup instructions

### 2. User Experience Issues (HIGH - FIXED)
**Issue**: Browser `alert()` dialogs for user feedback
```javascript
// Before (Unprofessional):
alert('Settings saved successfully!');

// After (Professional):
showToast('Settings saved successfully!', 'success');
```

**Improvements Made**:
- ✅ **ToastProvider**: Professional toast notification system with animations
- ✅ **ConfirmDialog**: Modern confirmation dialogs with variants
- ✅ **ErrorBoundary**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ **Loading States**: Proper feedback for async operations
